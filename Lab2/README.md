# Project 2, A* Algorithm

# Dependencies and Deployment
For Python dependencies, please refer to the `requirements.txt` file. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For convenience, I didn't pack node_modules, so you need to install the dependencies for the front-end part. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
To deploy the project, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
The project will be deployed on `http://localhost:3000/`.

Additionally, to run the Python version of question2, run the following command:
```bash
python3 Q2.py
```
It will output the result of the test cases, and sava the data and plot of the performance test.
